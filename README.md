# Serverless RPC

This takes code from https://github.com/bufferapp/micro-rpc and https://github.com/bufferapp/micro-rpc-client and fuses it with TypeScript ideas from https://github.com/aiden/rpc_ts to create an example of typesafe client - server RPC based on a [single definition file](https://github.com/ryardley/rpctest/blob/master/definition.ts).

The client and server components are both typesafe. This technique could be modified to create a more dynamic client.

This should work with no special Next.js configuration.
